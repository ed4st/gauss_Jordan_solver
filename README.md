# gauss_Jordan_solver
The Gauss-Jordan algorithm is a variation of Gaussian elimination. The two features that distinguish the Gauss-Jordan method from standard Gaussian elimination are: (i) each pivot element is forced to be 1; and (ii) the elements below and above the pivot are eliminated. Then, we develop a program that solves a n x n system using R.
